## 📄 Environment Setup

To reproduce the result, we need to install the environment for each tool:

- Let's take SGuardPlus as an example ([gcf3711/sGuardPlus: An automated smart contract vulnerability repair tool](https://github.com/gcf3711/sGuardPlus) ): 

- First, we need to clone the project;

- Second, install python3.8 and nodejs(v16);

- Then, we use the command to install the requirements:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  npm install
  ```

## 🔁 Reproducibility Steps

### Patch Processing For Traditional Repair  Tools

- First, change the source file path dir in solcversion.py that we use as **'path1'**. It is a dir contain all the contracts;

- Then, change the command of the traditional repair tool in ely.py that we use as **'smartfix_command'** as for SGuardPlus is **'node index.js {contract_file} >> {log_file}'**. We implement batch processing by changing the parameters of his single contract file to the set of them and we use log to record error or success messages ;

- Finally, use `solcversion.py` to patch processing, such as:

    ```bash
    python solcversion.py
    ```
